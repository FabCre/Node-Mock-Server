# Node-Mock-Server

## How it works

- Simple `index.js` which exports a function called `buildBasicMockServer`
- Use this function to build easily a json mock server
- Let us create a simple mock server with js object as response or with a function that create a js object
- Pure Node.JS, no dependencies needed
- Log every request with status code (200, 404) with color
- Manage a simple cache to reduce js object serialization
